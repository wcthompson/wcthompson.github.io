<h1> Hypertexual Starring of The Matrix </h1>
<h3> INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY</h3>

    <div><p> Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
    his age.  The Potentials are all little children.</p></div>

    <p>The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
    kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
    shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
    others meditating or practicing their gift.</p>

    <p>Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
    blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
    blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.</p>

    <p>Neo crosses to him, sits.</p>

    <p>The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
    imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
    it bend.</p>

                    <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
            <p>Your spoon does not bend because
            it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
            bends because there is no spoon,
            just my mind.</p>

    <p>Neo watches as it curls into a knot.</p>

                    <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
            <p>Link yourself to the spoon.
            Become the spoon and bend
            yourself.</p>

    <p>Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.</p>

                    <h3>NEO</h3>
            <p>There is no spoon.  Right.</p>

    <p>He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
    Priestess touches his shoulder.</p>

                    <h3>PRIESTESS</h3>
            <p>The Oracle will see you now.</p>

    <p>Spoon Boy smiles</p>


    <h3>INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY</h3>

    <p>Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
    zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
    a three-legged throne.</p>

    <p>The throne is empty.</p>

                    <h3>NEO</h3>
            <p>Hello?</p>

    <p>A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
    the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
    cooking.</p>

    <p>Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
    finds an open door.</p>

                    <h3>VOICE (O.S.)</h3>
            <p>Just come on in. </p>
