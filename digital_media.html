                <p> Barthes methodology of starring a text involves pouring through the symbolic coding of every moment of a text and breaking it down into it's 5 symbolic codes - <b>Hermeneutic</b>, <b>Proairetic</b>, <b>Semantic</b>, <b>Symbolic</b>, and <b>Cultural</b>. 
                This intensely analytic approach is surprisingly similar to the hypertextual annotations New York City startup Genius (formerly 'RapGenius') allows users to leave over the lyrics of 
                <a href="http://genius.com/Adele-hello-lyrics">songs</a>
                <a href="http://genius.com/Rihanna-work-lyrics">of</a>
                <a href="http://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-fire-away-lyrics">all</a>
                <a href="http://genius.com/David-bowie-blackstar-lyrics">genres</a>, and a varity of other mediums, including 
                <a href="http://genius.com/William-shakespeare-hamlet-act-3-scene-1-annotated"> classic literature </a> and even 
                <a href="http://genius.com/Law-and-order-svu-opening-line-annotated">television</a>. 
                <p>In a move to expand beyond the annotation of song lyrics, Genius released a browser extension called the <a href="http://genius.com/web-annotator">Web Annotator.</a> The annotator adds a mutual, "stereographic" hypertexual space to all text anywhere on the internet. Anyone with the extension can view the annotations of anyway else, and they can include images and gifs and hyperlinks in addition to text. I believe that Genius' is founded on Barthes' principals, making it the perfect tool for my own close-reading. I will be using the genius web annotator extension to star the script from two scenes of The Matrix (script source <a href="http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Matrix,-The.html">here</a>). In addition to using Barthes 5 codes, I am introducing my own code - the aesthetic code - to refer to the visual cues in scene that are specific to a visual medium, such as film. In more depth, the aesthetic code deals with cinematography, set and costume design, generally speaking things that may not be in the script itself, but are clear to any viewer.</p>

                <div><p> Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
                his age.  The Potentials are all little children.</p></div>

                <p>The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
                kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
                shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
                others meditating or practicing their gift.</p>

                <p>Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
                blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
                blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.</p>

                <p>Neo crosses to him, sits.</p>

                <p>The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
                imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
                it bend.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                                <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
                        <p>Your spoon does not bend because
                        it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
                        bends because there is no spoon,
                        just my mind.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Neo watches as it curls into a knot.</p>

                <div class="quote">
                                <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
                        <p>Link yourself to the spoon.
                        Become the spoon and bend
                        yourself.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.</p>

                <div class="quote">

                                <h3>NEO</h3>
                        <p>There is no spoon.  Right.</p>
                </div>

                <p>He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
                Priestess touches his shoulder.</p>

                <div class="quote">
                                <h3>PRIESTESS</h3>

                <p>Spoon Boy smiles</p>


                <h3>INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY</h3>

                <p>Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
                zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
                a three-legged throne.</p>

                <p>The throne is empty.</p>
                <div class="quote">

                </div>
                <p>A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
                the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
                cooking.</p>

                <p>Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
                finds an open door.</p>
