        <h3> INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY</h3>

            <div><p> Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
            his age.  The Potentials are all little children.</p></div>

            <p>The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
            kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
            shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
            others meditating or practicing their gift.</p>

            <p>Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
            blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
            blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.</p>

            <p>Neo crosses to him, sits.</p>

            <p>The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
            imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
            it bend.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                            <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
                    <p>Your spoon does not bend because
                    it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
                    bends because there is no spoon,
                    just my mind.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Neo watches as it curls into a knot.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                            <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
                    <p>Link yourself to the spoon.
                    Become the spoon and bend
                    yourself.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.</p>

            <div class="quote">

                            <h3>NEO</h3>
                    <p>There is no spoon.  Right.</p>
            </div>

            <p>He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
            Priestess touches his shoulder.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                            <h3>PRIESTESS</h3>
                    <p>The Oracle will see you now.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Spoon Boy smiles</p>


            <h3>INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY</h3>

            <p>Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
            zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
            a three-legged throne.</p>

            <p>The throne is empty.</p>
            <div class="quote">

                            <h3>NEO</h3>
                    <p>Hello?</p>
            </div>
            <p>A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
            the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
            cooking.</p>

            <p>Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
            finds an open door.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                            <h3>VOICE (O.S.)</h3>
