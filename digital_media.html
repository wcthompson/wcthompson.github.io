                <p> Barthes methodology of starring a text involves pouring through the symbolic coding of every moment of a text and breaking it down into it's 5 symbolic codes - <b>Hermeneutic (HER)</b>, <b>Proairetic (ACT)</b>, <b>Semantic (SEM)</b>, <b>Symbolic (SYM)</b>, and <b>Cultural (REF)</b>. 
                This intensely analytic approach is surprisingly similar to the hypertextual annotations New York City startup Genius (formerly 'RapGenius') allows users to leave over the lyrics of 
                <a href="http://genius.com/Adele-hello-lyrics">songs</a>
                <a href="http://genius.com/Rihanna-work-lyrics">of</a>
                <a href="http://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-fire-away-lyrics">all</a>
                <a href="http://genius.com/David-bowie-blackstar-lyrics">genres</a>, and a varity of other mediums, including 
                <a href="http://genius.com/William-shakespeare-hamlet-act-3-scene-1-annotated"> classic literature </a> and even 
                <a href="http://genius.com/Law-and-order-svu-opening-line-annotated">television</a>. 
                <p>In a move to expand beyond the annotation of song lyrics, Genius released a browser extension called the <a href="http://genius.com/web-annotator">Web Annotator.</a> The annotator adds a mutual, "stereographic" hypertexual space to all text anywhere on the internet. Anyone with the extension can view the annotations of anyway else, and they can include images and gifs and hyperlinks in addition to text. I believe that Genius' is founded on Barthes' principals, making it the perfect tool for my own close-reading. I will be using the genius web annotator extension to star the script from two scenes of The Matrix (script source <a href="http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Matrix,-The.html">here</a>). In addition to using Barthes 5 codes, I am introducing my own code - the aesthetic code (AES - to refer to the visual cues in scene that are specific to a visual medium, such as film. In more depth, the aesthetic code deals with cinematography, set and costume design, generally speaking things that may not be in the script itself, but are clear to any viewer.</p>

                    Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
                    <h3>MORPHEUS</h3>
                    Thank you.
                    <h3>PRIESTESS</h3>
                    Neo, come with me.
                </div>

                <p>She leads Neo down another hall and into what appears to
                be a family room.</p>
                <p>There is another woman in white sitting on a couch
                watching a soap opera. Scattered about the room are a
                half dozen children. Some of them are playing, others are
                deep in meditation. All of them exude a kind of Zen calm.</p>

                    These are the other Potentials. You can wait here.

                <p>Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
                blocks. Closer to him, a SKINNY BOY with a shaved head
                holds a spoon which sways like a blade of grass.
                In front of him is a pile of spoons bent and twisted into
                knots. Neo crosses to him and sits. The boy smiles and
                hands Neo the spoon which is now perfectly straight.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                <h3>SPOON BOY (SKINNY BOY)</h3>
                    Do not try to bend the spoon.
                    That is impossible. Instead, only
                    try to realize the truth.
                    <h3>NEO</h3>
                    What truth?
                    <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
                    That there is no spoon.
                    Neo nods, staring at the spoon.
                    <h3>NEO</h3>
                    There is no spoon.
                    <h3>SPOON BOY</h3>
                    Then you will see that it is not
                    the spoon that bends. It is only
                    yourself.
                </div>
                <p>The entire room is reflected inside the spoon and as Neo
                stares into it, it slowly begins to bend until --
                A hand touches his shoulder. </p>
                <div class="quote">
                <h3>PRIESTESS</h3>
                The Oracle will see you now.
                Spoon Boy smiles.
